# A Moodstocks Mailer

This is a simple Ruby mailer (around 100 LOC!) that makes possible to interact with [Moodstocks API](http://extranet.moodstocks.com/) via any mail client and thus any smartphone!

Behind the scenes you'll simply need a Gmail account, [getmail](http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/) and a few gems.

## Usage

Please refer to the [related article](https://github.com/Moodstocks/moodstocks-api/wiki/ms-mailer) for all details.
