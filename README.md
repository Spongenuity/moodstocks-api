# Moodstocks API kits

## Description

This is a collection of snippets written in various languages
that act as [Moodstocks API](http://www.moodstocks.com/visual-search-as-a-service/)
clients.

write the code and we'll add it!

## About the API

[Moodstocks API](http://www.moodstocks.com/visual-search-as-a-service/)
enables you to integrate visual search into your app with no effort, through an
HTTP REST web service with responses delivered in JSON format.

Moodstocks API is an authenticated service: to interact with it you'll first
need to [register for an account](http://api.moodstocks.com/signup), create an
access key and import some images to recognize.

For more details feel free to contact us either by email at
<contact@moodstocks.com>, or via our
